# Waku Guide

Waku is a decentralized, censorship-resistant, network and protocol family.
It enables you to add communication features to your dApp in a decentralized manner,
ensuring to your users that they will not be censored or de-platformed.

Waku can be used for chat (human-to-human) purposes and for many machine-to-machine use cases.

Here you can find general, high level explanation of Waku concepts.

If you want to learn how Waku works under the hoods, check out the [10/WAKU2](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/10/) RFC.
